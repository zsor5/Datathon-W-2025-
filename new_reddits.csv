The way I see him he was like a 6'9-6'10 Kobe on offense with better playmaking skills, but his defense left something to be desired.

Jayson Tatum on the other hand is a proven winner with more accolades than Mcgrady had. A crazy stat is Tatum has the most playoff points ever for players age 27 and under. 2 Finals appearances and has been to the ECF the majority of his career.

I told my grandparents everything and they sided with me, my grandpa was angry and he said that my brother already got his inheritance from our parents so he won't get anything from them and he said his share of inheritance will go to me, to my college fees and other expenses and whatever I would like to do next

My grandpa lectured him alot and told him that he betrayed me and he should've been taking care of me instead of his wife and told him all his money is going to me, the lecture lasted a long time

Well, folks. Buckle up because this situation went from a soap opera to a full-blown telenovela.

So after my last post, I took everyone‚Äôs advice and locked my dress away in a safe place. My sister continued guilt-tripping me, my parents doubled down on calling me ‚Äúselfish,‚Äù and I continued standing my ground.

Then, a week ago, THE DRESS WENT MISSING. My childhood Spidey senses tingled, and sure enough, my mom ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù let it slip that my sister had borrowed it. BORROWED. As in, stole.

I was furious. I immediately drove to my parents' house, and there it was‚ÄîMY EFFIN DREAM DRESS‚Äîlaid out on the dining table like some sort of sacrificial lamb, with fabric samples and scissors nearby.

I lost it. I grabbed the dress, stormed out, and on my way home, I got a text from my sister:

""If you take that dres, don‚Äôt bother coming to my wedding.""

Oh. Ohhhhhh. Game on.

I went home, poured myself a big glass of wine, and started thinking. Then, like a vengeful rom-com protagonist, I had the most petty, most diabolical idea ever.

I booked a spa weekend for my husband and me on the same day as her wedding. Not just any spa‚Äîa luxury, five-star, champagne-filled getaway. Then, I posted about it. On social media. With the caption:

""So grateful to be spending this weekend with the love of my life, celebrating the best decision I ever made: my wedding. Wishing everyone a day as joyful as ours was!""

SHE WENT BALLISTIC.

Blowing up my phone. Screaming in texts. Calling me a ‚Äújealous, bitter b\*\*\*\*‚Äù for ruining her big day. Our parents begged me to apologize, saying my sister was inconsolable. I told them:

""Oh, so now it‚Äôs a big deal when someone‚Äôs special moment is ruined? Funny how that works.""

And let me tell you, I have never sipped mimosas more victoriously than I did that weekend.

Now? My sister still isn‚Äôt talking to me, my parents are ‚Äúdisappointed,‚Äù and I‚Äôm still in possession of my wedding dress. And honestly? I have never been happier.

Her birthday was yesterday and a few days before she told me that she wanted to go to this expensive restaurant that she has always wanted to try. I love her and wanted to make her birthday special so I agreed.

We got to the restaurant and had a pretty good time despite the fact that she ordered some of the most expensive items on the menu. I just enjoyed the fact that she seemed to be enjoying herself. She was taking lots of pictures of the food, the flowers I got her and everything. She told me that it was the best birthday she has ever had and that none of her ex boyfriends had ever made this much effort on her birthday. 

This made me feel pretty good because I was anxious about doing everything right so that she has a good time. On our way back she thanked me and told me that I am a really good guy and she a great time today but she doesn't think that this relationship will work and wants to break up. At first I thought she was just playing around until I realized that she was serious.

I asked her why and she said that she is just not attracted to me, she tried but it's just not there and she doesn't want to string me along as it would be unfair to the both of us. So anyway we had an awkward ride back while the driver tried making cheerful conversation.

TL;DR I took my girlfriend out on an expensive birthday date and she broke up with me on our way back and the driver heard all of it and tried cheering me up.

EDIT: I decided to text her and asked her if she could please reimburse me for her part of the meal as it's only fair and she blocked me after reading the message.

"1323",NA,"AmIOverreacting","My niece (16) has been living with me and my fiance for a little under a year now. My fianc√© knew her since she was 5 and she  didn‚Äôt have a healthy house environment for years so I didn‚Äôt hesitate to bring her in when my fianc√© asked if she can stay with us. I‚Äôve spent a good amount of my own money to get her situated including the phone and her own room and furnished it. Since then, we‚Äôve realized how glued she is to her phone. She stays on TikTok all day and talks to her friends literally all day. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where the school has emailed us how distracted she is and just been fucking off in school. Tons of missing assignments and grades aren‚Äôt the best and is slipping. We‚Äôve reached an agreement to finally take her phone away but after the weekend we come home from vacation that my fianc√© and I were just going. We trusted her to stay home by herself even with the help with my family coming over to check up on her everyday. Not even a few hours after we landed to our destination she lost my dog. I was devastated. It completely ruined my vacation and I felt almost depressed. My cousin reminded her multiple times to bring him inside and brushed it off because she was on her phone the whole time she was there to check up on her. I found out that it took almost 3 hours for her to realize my dog was still outside and he was gone. When i finally came home i took her phone and smashed it to pieces. 

This dog meant a lot meant to me. I‚Äôve had him for almost 7 years.  I‚Äôm actually paralyzed and I got him about 6 months after my accident. He was the first dog I‚Äôve gotten myself and was a REALLY good dog that everybody loved. He was basically my emotional support dog. The whole house vibe is noticeably down. And my fiance thinks smashing her phone was overkill. And now we‚Äôve been arguing and haven‚Äôt really been talking AIO? 

TLDR: I‚Äôve had my dog ever since I gotten paralyzed so about 7 years now. Couple hours into my vacation, I get a call that my niece forgot to bring in my dog. And now he‚Äôs missing.

"2399",1740085555.69449,"cats","I‚Äôm sorry for the long post; a friend recommended writing my feelings out to help cope with what just happened. I typed everything out without proof reading and just let my thoughts flow through.

I lost my baby girl Ella after taking her to the vet last week for being lethargic. I knew something was wrong after noticing her quiet behavior for two days and got an appointment the same day. They said she was extremely lethargic, dehydrated, and after running blood work they said she was very anemic. They suggested we take her to the animal hospital over an hour away immediately for most likely a blood transfusion and testing they can‚Äôt offer locally. We rushed her there and got her the blood transfusion &amp; over the course of two days ran every suggested test they said would help find the reason for her anemia. All signs led to cancer of the blood marrow but was not definitive. They said we could do a flow cytometry which was to be sent to Colorado to further look into the blood cells and should tell us what was going on. I was able to take her home which I was so excited to start her on the prednisolone and antibiotic the doctor gave, hoping it would make her better. She was very tired but I could tell in better condition than before. I opted in for the liquid medication because I knew she was not going to let me put a pill in her mouth lol, she even fought me with the liquid meds. After about three days she wasn‚Äôt eating much again and barely drank any water. I spent every night with her these past few days, just petting her, telling her how much I love her, and that I could not have asked for a better kitty. Even though she was extremely weak she would get out of her little bed and position herself on my arm and fall asleep. Yesterday morning I realized she‚Äôs not having any good days and I didn‚Äôt want my baby to suffer anymore. I work from home and I brought all of my office things into her bedroom and I just worked on the floor right next to her while she slept. I finally got a call back from the vet hospital yesterday and they said the flow cytometry was inconclusive and I told them about her condition and that she wasn‚Äôt getting any better. She said the only option is to bring her back, get another transfusion, a few more tests (bone marrow by putting her asleep) and potentially prescribing another steroid on top of the pred. I had been crying all morning and on the phone I asked the vet ‚Äúam I wrong to let her go and put her down‚Äù and she said absolutely not and she would consider doing the same thing if it was her baby. I knew it was time and I tried calling laps of love and any at home service because I wanted it to be stress free for my baby because she hates going in the crate and didn‚Äôt want her last moments to be stressful especially with how anemic and dehydrated she was. All the at-home clinics did not have any appointments yesterday so I called my primary vet (I had an appointment yesterday for blood work for her) and told them I don‚Äôt want her doing any more tests and that I would like to put her down. They offered for me to bring her in right away and that we would have a room on arrival. Knowing it was about to happen I was crushed, I set up a blanket in her crate and picked her up and she started crying as I put her in the crate and it crushed me even more. The car ride was about ten minutes and she kept crying and I kept telling her I loved her and that she won‚Äôt have to do this anymore and I kept thanking her for being my best friend. When we got to the vet they brought us into a room and I let her out of her crate and put her in my lap and pet her. She finally stopped crying and was just putting her face in my arms. I felt like she was just so scared and didn‚Äôt want to go through this again. The doctor who saw her originally last week walked in and she was extremely thoughtful and caring and I just started asking her questions and if she knew what could be wrong and she also stated it was most likely cancer. I asked if it was wrong to be bringing her in to put her down and she said it was not, she explained how usually with steroids the cats react fairly quickly and are alert and moving around, she said that she unfortunately looks even worse than when we brought her in last week and that she saw all of the tests we had completed for her and that we went above and beyond in trying to make her better. She offered one of two ways to put her down; she recommended starting with a muscle relaxant/sedative to calm her down and then put the needle for euthanasia. I said that will most likely be the route but I wanted to wait for my wife to arrive which was around 5 minutes. Once my wife came in we agreed the sedative would be best. After 15 minutes of being in the room, my wife and a tech went to the front to discuss what we want for after she passed. All of the sudden my baby girl starts crying and almost screaming, I started asking for help as I was holding her and I could tell she‚Äôs losing consciousness her body went limp and her arm started raising, my wife grabbed her from me and I looked at the tech and said please help her now, she brought her into their back room and I‚Äôm telling you it was the worst moment of my life. I sat there sobbing just saying I‚Äôm so sorry, I kept telling my wife this is why I wanted to do it at home, I knew this was too much for her. The doctor came back in the room after about 3 minutes and I just looked at her and asked is she alive? She said yes, she‚Äôs on oxygen right now, she‚Äôs just so anemic that all of this is taxing her body and she went into shock, she offered for us to come into the back room. They had just gave her the sedative/muscle relaxant. I was so relieved to see her calm again, she was alert and I was allowed to pet her and kiss her and talk to her the entire time. They said it would only take a few minutes for her to sleep but may take just a little longer for her to fall asleep due to her poor circulation. They held an oxygen tube in front of her nose the entire time, I rested my head the metal table just looking at her but her head wasn‚Äôt turned towards me (I honesty believe she was upset with me for putting her through this) but I kept petting her telling her how much I love her and that we will meet again one day. After about ten minutes they asked how she was doing and if she was asleep and she raised her head up and pretty much was saying no I‚Äôm not. It took about twenty minutes for her to finally look like she was about to go to sleep and with her last bit of strength she lifted her head up and rested infront of of my face and looked at me, she hadn‚Äôt purred the entire time we were at the vet but when she turned and looked at me she purred for about 15-20 seconds. I told her it was okay and I‚Äôll see you again. The doctor was then able to put the IV into her arm and put her to sleep. The doctor checked her heart after about a minute and said she was gone. We were allowed to bring her back into our original room and I carried her in a blanket they swaddled her in. I held her and laid her on the table and brought a chair to sit on and just talked to her, told her how much I loved her, I apologized for making it so stressful her last 1.5 hours of life, I thanked her for being the best kitty I could have asked for, I told her I will never forget her and that I will see her again one day and that we will cuddle every single day. She looked so peaceful laying there, I gave her so many kisses and the vets let us take as much time as we needed. My wife and I were in there for about twenty minutes and it was so hard to press that button to let them take her back. After I said my goodbyes we pressed the button and they took her back. We ended up going for the clay paw prints, private cremation, and some patches of fur that should be available within a week or two. I‚Äôm excited I will get to bring part of her back home. It hurts so much and the only regret I have is maybe waiting one more day to have it done at home so she didn‚Äôt have to go through all of that, no animal deserves that, and I don‚Äôt think hearing those cries or seeing her go lifeless like that will be something I ever forget for the rest of my life. That‚Äôs the part that hurts the most is knowing she went through that in her last moments. Today I cried just because I missed her and having to go back into her bedroom to grab my work stuff and not seeing her there. I do believe I made the right decision it‚Äôs just so hard because she was only 8 years old and I never got a definitive answer. 

Ella, I want you to know daddy loves you so much and I can‚Äôt thank you enough for bringing me so much love and joy the past 8 years. I‚Äôm so thankful I was able to adopt you, raise you, play with you, give you treats, cuddles, and watch you grow. You loved just being around me; countless hours in the morning when I slept in (you wouldn‚Äôt move off the bed unless I did), if you were laying in another part of the house and I laid on the couch, I‚Äôd hear you pounce down and jump right up next to me. I‚Äôll miss your snuggles, your purring, and countless head to head rubs. I‚Äôll miss everything about you baby girl.
